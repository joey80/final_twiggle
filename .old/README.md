# Twiggle

"Twiggle" is a todo app that has a simple HTML/CSS/JS frontend with a PHP/MySQL backend. I used AJAX to connect to the PHP API's to fetch the data and update the results without a refresh. The user logins are handled with Auth0 and they really make things easy. I'm looking forward to adding more and more features to this as time goes on. One of the next things I would like to add is the ability to create several different todo list categories.
